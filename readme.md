# Pebble Fit Progress

This is a simple wathface designed to show the difference between your current step count, your current typical, and your typical for the day. It includes the time, date, step count, and heart rate.

The step count is also indicated visually by a border that fills in as you approach your typical total for the day.  A small dot indicates where you would normally be at this point in the day.
